## Noticeboard + Dashboard

This first iteration/mvp will consist of a dashboard (like a block explorer for meme markets) and
a a noticeboard dapp. Both will live in the same application (for now).

This code is taken from Token Factory (https://github.com/ConsenSys/Token-Factory) since I know that codebase.

I'm not a fan of the codebase since I prefer redux these days (and I coded Token Factory whilst also learning React). However, for the sake of quickly scaffolding an MVP, I started with just forking that.

If the MVP is working okay/good and there's interest, I will move to porting this over to a better codebase.

NOTE: This is NOT runnable atm and very WIP. I made a commit mainly to post the contracts so long.

## Developing
